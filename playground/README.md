## Documentation
The `psh` supports the following Unix-like operating system commands:
```c
ls    [file ... | directory ...]
echo  [string ...] [>>] [file]
touch [file ...]
mkdir [directory ...]
cd    [directory]
cat   [file]
rm    [-r] [file ... | directories ...]
rmdir [directories ...]
```
The listed commands follow a behavior similar to the `zsh`.
